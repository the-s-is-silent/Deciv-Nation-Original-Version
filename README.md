# Deciv Nation (Original Version)
Strictly based on the first version of the mod from EmperorVboiuerfg which added the faction of Capitalia, essentially a "playable city-state", to DeCiv. This version attempts to expand on the original's limited lore while also rebalancing the faction's abilities and components.
